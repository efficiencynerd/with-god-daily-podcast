      <title>Worship, Beauty, & Justice</title>
      <description>This devotional argues that a consumerist, utilitarian mindset often infects Christian worship, leading us to see God and people as valuable only if useful or transactional. Instead, true worship should embrace beauty and "impracticality" to counteract this impulse and remind us that God and all humanity are to be adored. This adoration, expressed through valuing what isn't useful, is the essential prelude to pursuing justice for the oppressed and neglected.</description>

      <title>Beautiful Worship</title>
      <description>This devotional highlights the difference between transactional and genuine worship, using the example of the woman anointing Jesus. It teaches that true Christian worship is an impractical, beautiful act of adoration, motivated by love for God's intrinsic worth rather than practical utility or personal gain. Genuine worship flows from a heart captivated by God's beauty, pouring out our highest value as a pure expression of devotion.</description>

      <title>Don?t Worship Like a Pagan</title>
      <description>This devotional contrasts pagan mythologies, where humans serve gods out of necessity, with the biblical truth that God is self-sufficient and does not *need* our worship or offerings. It argues that viewing worship as a transaction?offering praise to receive blessings?is a pagan mindset, not true Christianity. Instead, proper Christian worship is a non-transactional act of adoring God as an end in Himself, finding spiritual fulfillment in simply gazing upon His beauty and discovering His reciprocal adoration for us.</description>

      <title>A Nonsensical Gesture of Love</title>
      <description>This devotional argues that authentic Christian worship is a "nonsensical gesture of love," spontaneously offered to God from an encounter with His holiness, rather than a pragmatic calculation of personal gain or institutional growth. It challenges modern tendencies to approach worship with marketplace metrics, urging believers to embrace a selfless delight in God that transcends utility and feedback.</description>

      <title>Ground Control, We Have a Problem</title>
      <description>Drawing from the experience of astronauts who needed to pause for cosmic reflection, this devotional emphasizes that Christians require intentional rest and meditation, particularly through Sunday worship. This practice allows us to gain God's perspective on our lives and work, fostering spiritual renewal and communion rather than solely focusing on relentless activity. Ultimately, it calls for a rhythm of mission and meditation to maintain a proper perspective on ourselves, our calling, and our Lord.</description>

      <title>No Rest for the Weary</title>
      <description>This devotional emphasizes the spiritual call for pastors to act as true shepherds by actively providing rest and restoration for God's people, as depicted in Psalm 23. It criticizes how the contemporary church often mirrors societal work addiction, inadvertently demanding more labor from congregants and contributing to burnout and church dropout rates instead of offering genuine sabbath. Therefore, the church must prioritize creating space for rest to truly care for its flock.</description>

      <title>Why Not Saturday?</title>
      <description>The Old Testament Sabbath, rooted in Israel's deliverance from Egyptian slavery, symbolized freedom from bondage, a principle Jesus demonstrated by healing on the Sabbath to liberate people from suffering. For Christians, this ultimate freedom was achieved through Christ's resurrection on Sunday, transforming the Sabbath into a mission to seek deliverance for all people from every form of spiritual and physical bondage.</description>
