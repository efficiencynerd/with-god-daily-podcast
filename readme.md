I wanted a way to get the audio from the daily email into a podcast-like format.

The initial problem arose like this. I do not like to have my phone in my bedroom while sleeping as it's too distracting and I find leads to unhealthly sleeping habits. I do however wear a smartwatch. I also like listening to this devotional first thing in the morning. There was no way to use my smartwatch to click the audio link from the email and start it in my headphones. Thus, this podcast feed was born. There is a Google Apps script in the background that grabs the link from my email each morning and posts it here.

Created with the help of Claude and ChatGPT. If you are Skye Jethani and are upset that I created this feed, let's talk... my intention was simply to make an easy way for me to get to the audio version of your devotionals.

All credit where credit is due, I didn't make the devotional or have anything to do with it, just repackaging the audio in a format that is personally beneficial for me.
